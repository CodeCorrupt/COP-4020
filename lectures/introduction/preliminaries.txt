** student introductions (HW0)

   Students need to do homework 0 by Friday (11pm!)
         to tell us about their programming language experience and interests
   
        - Ask for a favorite programming language,
          get votes for each

   keep track of votes for languages on the board.

        Q: How is a programming language like a religion?
                seems to get the same kind of devotion from its followers

                We're asking you to experience a new religion!

        It's also something like moving:
             disorienting, but you may learn things and meet new friends
